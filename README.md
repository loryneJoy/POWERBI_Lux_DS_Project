# 🎯 Power BI RCPA Dashboard Project

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involved building a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** based on **Retail Chemist Prescription Audit (RCPA)** data.  
The goal was to demonstrate a complete **ETL process**, establish meaningful **data relationships**, and deliver **insightful visualizations** to analyze:

- Doctor prescription performance  
- Doctor conversion status  
- Brand competition by region

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The datasets used include:

| Dataset Name          | Description                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **RCPA Reporting Form**  | Raw prescription audit data by doctors |
| **Product Master**        | Product details including brand and category |
| **Brand Targets**         | Target prescription quantities per brand  |
| **Expected Transformation** | Guide for data cleaning and transformation |

## ✨ What I Did in This Project

### 🔄 ETL Using Power Query

- Cleaned and transformed raw RCPA and competitor data based on the **Expected Transformation** sheet.  
- Merged with product master data and aggregated prescription quantities.  
- Created **RCPA Data** and **Competitor RCPA Data** tables ready for analysis.

### 🗂️ Built a Robust Data Model

- Defined **relationships** between RCPA Data, Competitor Data, Product Master, and Brand Targets.  
- Ensured **correct cardinality** and **cross-filter directions** for accurate data aggregation and filtering.

### 📈 Developed Interactive Visualizations

- **Doctor Rx Performance:** Prescription quantities vs brand targets, segmented by medical rep and region.  
- **Doctor Conversion Status:** Highlights doctors consistently meeting targets across multiple periods.  
- **Brand Competition:** Compares market share of our products vs competitors by region.

### 🧮 Created Business Logic with DAX

- Built custom DAX measures to calculate doctor conversion and track prescription trends over time.

### 💡 Delivered a User-Friendly Dashboard

- Interactive and intuitive for stakeholders to drill down into performance metrics and identify growth opportunities.
